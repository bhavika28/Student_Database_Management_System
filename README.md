# Student_Database_Management_System
C++ Project (OOP)

A student database is a platform that can be used to record and store all the details of the
students. Details like performance in each subject or any other information that is a milestone in
the student’s growth is recorded and stored in the database. These records are attached to the
student’s profile, so that the information is easily accessible when required, hence the project’s
aim is achieved.
